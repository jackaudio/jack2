    period time in microseconds (before it was a scaled
    version of the difference w.r.t. the nominal value).
    This allows this value to be made available to clients
    that are interested in it (see jack_get_cycle_times).
    This change also means that 'fPeriodUsecs' must be
    initialised to the nominal period time instead of zero.
    This is done in the first cycle in jack_run_cycle().

   'fFilterCoefficient' is renamed to 'fFilterOmega'. It
    is now equal to the 'omega' value as defined in the
    'Using a DLL to filter time' paper (before it was a
    scaled version of this value). It is computed once in
    jack_run_cycle() rather than set to a fixed value. This
    makes the DLL bandwidth independent of the period time.
