\brief The base class for audio drivers: drivers with audio ports.

A concrete derived class will have to be defined with a real audio driver API, 
either callback based one (like CoreAudio, PortAudio..) ones or blocking ones (like ALSA).

Most of the generic audio handing code is part of this class :
    - concrete callback basedd derived subclasses typically have to Open/Close the underlying audio API, 
        setup the audio callback and implement the Read/Write methods
    - concrete blocking based derived subclasses typically have to Open/Close the underlying audio API, 
        implement the Read/Write methods and "wraps" the driver with the JackThreadDriver class.
