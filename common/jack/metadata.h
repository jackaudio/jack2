 * A single property (key:value pair).
 *
 * Although there is no semantics imposed on metadata keys and values, it is
 * much less useful to use it to associate highly structured data with a port
 * (or client), since this then implies the need for some (presumably
 * library-based) code to parse the structure and be able to use it.
 *
 * The real goal of the metadata API is to be able to tag ports (and clients)
 * with small amounts of data that is outside of the core JACK API but
 * nevertheless useful.
