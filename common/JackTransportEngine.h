\brief The client transport structure.

We have:

	- a "current" position
	- a "pending" position prepared by the server at each cycle
	- a "request" position wanted by a client

	At the beginning of a cycle the server needs to select a new current position. When a request and a pending position are available,
	the request takes precedence on the pending one. The server atomically switches to the new position.
	The current position can be read by clients.

	We use a JackAtomicArrayState pattern that allows to manage several "next" states independantly.

    In jack1 implementation, transport code (jack_transport_cycle_end) was not called if the graph could not be locked (see jack_run_one_cycle).
    Here transport cycle (CycleBegin, CycleEnd) has to run in the RT thread concurrently with code executed from the "command" thread.

    Each client maintains a state in it's shared memory area defined by:

    - it's current transport state
    - a boolean that is "true" when slow-sync cb has to be called
    - a boolean that is "true" when timebase cb is called with new_pos on

    Several operations set the "slow-sync cb" flag to true:

        - setting a new cb (client)
        - activate (client)
        - transport start (server)
        - new pos (server)

    Slow-sync cb calls stops when:

        - the cb return true (client)
        - desactivate (client)
        - transport stop (server)

    Several operations set the "timebase cb" flag to true:

        - setting a new cb (client)
        - activate (client)
        - transport start (server) ??
        - new pos (server)

    Timebase cb "new_pos" argument calls stops when:

        - after one cb call with "new_pos" argument true (client)
        - desactivate (client)
        - release (client)
        - transport stop (server)
