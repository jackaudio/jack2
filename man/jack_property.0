.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBjack_property\fR can be used to list, set and delete any and all metadata associated with the ports
and clients of a JACK server.
.P
There are three main ways to use the command. The \fB-l\fR option is used to list existing metadata. The \fB-s\fR option is used
to set metadata. The \fB-d/-D\fR options are used to delete metadata.
.P
The \fIidentifier\fR is normally a UUID (UUIDs for ports and clients can be shown with jack_lsp(1)). If the \fB-c\fR option is used, then \fIidentifier\fR will
be interpreted as a client name, and its UUID will be looked up internally and used for the relevant metadata operation. If the \fB-p\fR option is used, then \fIidentifier\fR will
be interpreted as a port name and its UUID  will be looked up internally and used for the relevant metadata operation.
.P
The \fIkey\fR is an arbitary string that identifies the metadata to be operated upon.
.P
The \fIvalue\fR is an arbitrary string that defines the value of the metadata to be created.
.P
The \fItype\fR is an optional MIME type, given as a string. An empty type for a piece of metadata results in it being interpreted as "text/UTF-8".
