Introduction
------------

This guide contains detailed instructions for building JACK on a modern MinGW
installation. It was conceived as the starting point for unifying the JACK build
process across all platforms.

As this is work in progress, there are still a couple of caveats:

- Asynchronous mode is unusable with low latencies
- JackRouter still builds using a Visual Studio project
- Lots of real world testing is needed



Creating the development environment
------------------------------------

This guide uses MSYS2 as the toolchain, it can be found at https://www.msys2.org/
It comes as a handy installer called msys2-x86_64-{version}.exe. Once installed:

- Open "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal" from the MSYS2 start menu shortcuts

- Upgrade base MSYS2 packages

pacman -Suy

It is possible pacman ends with the following banner:

warning: terminate MSYS2 without returning to shell and check for updates again
warning: for example close your terminal window instead of calling exit

In such case close the MSYS2 window, re-open, and run pacman -Suy again.

- Install required packages

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain patch autoconf make \
gettext-devel automake libtool pkgconfig p7zip unzip git python

- Replace the GCC compiler with a version configured for SJLJ exceptions, as
instructed by the original Windows build instructions (windows/README)

Prebuilt binaries can be found at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/

Look for "x86_64-posix-sjlj" under "MinGW-W64 GCC-{version}", the file should be
called x86_64-{version}-release-posix-sjlj-rt_v6-rev0.7z

Or just download from a direct link (GCC 8.1.0):

wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mingw-w64/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-posix/sjlj/x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-sjlj-rt_v6-rev0.7z

Once downloaded:

p7zip -d x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-sjlj-rt_v6-rev0.7z

That will decompress to a folder called mingw64 in the working directory.
Now replace the files from the previous mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain package
installation:

mv /mingw64 /mingw64.bak   -> backup original
rm /mingw64                -> see explanation below
mv mingw64 /               -> sjlj toolchain

The first step results in a new file called mingw64 file being created in /. The
file is not visible to the Windows File Explorer when inspecting C:\msys64, so
it is probably an artifact and safe to delete it in the second step. Otherwise
the last mv step will fail with:

mv: cannot overwrite non-directory '/mingw64' with directory 'mingw64'

An alternate solution consists in closing the MSYS2 window and replicating the
above procedure using the File Explorer. The following assumes the toolchain 7z
file was decompressed to the home directory:

Rename C:\msys64\mingw64 to C:\msys64\mingw64.bak
Move C:\msys64\home\{username}\mingw64 to C:\msys64

Make sure gcc runs and it is the expected version:

$ gcc --version
gcc.exe (x86_64-posix-sjlj-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) {version}

In case gcc is not recognized in the step before, add mingw64 directory to PATH

export PATH=/mingw64/bin:$PATH


Preparing JACK dependencies
---------------------------

There are prebuilt MinGW binaries for all the libraries that can be installed
using the pacman package manager, but since we are using a compiler that is not
the default version shipped by MinGW, it seems better idea to build from source
to avoid any linker and runtime issues. A good technical explanation and/or
evidence for this statement is currently missing from this guide.

Fortunately there are PKGBUILD files for doing so together with a nice guide at
https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages

git clone https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages.git

Before building libraries, adjust the includes path:

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/mingw64/include

The basic procedure for building and installing libraries is:

cd MINGW-packages/mingw-w64-{libname}
MINGW_INSTALLS=mingw64 makepkg-mingw -sLf
pacman -U mingw-w64-{libname}-{suffix}.pkg.tar.xz

Repeat the procedure for each library listed below replacing {libname} with the
appropriate name and {suffix} with whatever the above process creates. Keep the
recommended build order, for example libsamplerate depends on libsndfile, and
libsystre depends on libtre-git. libsystre is a wrapper around libtre that
allows including <regex.h> later.

Some libraries like libsndfile and libsamplerate will ask for installing extra
dependencies, it is ok to do so.

For low latency audio it is recommended to build portaudio with ASIO support, so
the Steinberg ASIO SDK should be manually downloaded beforehand. It can be found
at https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html. The waf script will
later check if the SDK is present at /opt/asiosdk

wget https://www.steinberg.net/asiosdk -O /tmp/asiosdk.zip
unzip /tmp/asiosdk.zip -d /tmp
mkdir /opt   <- MinGW does not create /opt during installation
mv /tmp/asiosdk_{version}_{date} /opt/asiosdk

The description file in portaudio (MINGW-packages/mingw-w64-portaudio/PKGBUILD)
needs to be patched so configure is called with the necessary flags for ASIO:

--with-asiodir=/opt/asiosdk   <- new option
--with-winapi=wmme,directx,wasapi,vdmks,asio   <- append 'asio' to existing

Both static and shared library versions of portaudio are built. To prevent
errors while building the shared version or recompiling static, also insert the
following lines in PKGBUILD after the first make call (around line 60) and after
second make (around line 70):

find /opt/asiosdk -name "*.lo" -type f -delete
find /opt/asiosdk -name "*.o" -type f -delete

Finally here is the list of libraries to build:

db
libsndfile
libsamplerate
libtre-git
libsystre
portaudio



Compiling JACK
--------------

Clone repo:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2

Configure build (including the pre-built libraries in order to receive a warning
if they are not recognized):

cd jack2
./waf configure --prefix=/opt/jack --portaudio --samplerate --sndfile --db

In case the pre-built libraries are not recognized in the step before, add
mingw64 directory to PKG_CONFIG_PATH:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/mingw64/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Build and install:

./waf -p install

The resulting files can be found at /c/opt/jack/bin, or C:\msys64\opt\jack\bin



Compiling JackRouter (optional)
-------------------------------

JackRouter allows non-JACK applications to connect to the server through a
special ASIO driver that routes audio to JACK instead of a physical audio
device. Therefore, this is an optional component if you only want to use
JACK-native application.

Visual Studio with MFC support is needed to build the included JackRouter VS
project. The project was tested to successfully generate a 64bit version of
JackRouter.dll using Visual Studio 2017 and 2019. MFC support can be added from
the VS installer, by selecting Workloads/Visual C++ build tools/Visual C++ MFC
for x86 and x64 (valid for VS 2017). Once ready, just open and build the project

windows/JackRouter/JackRouter_MinGW_deps.vcxproj

Differences from the original JackRouter.vcxproj:

- Depends on the asiosdk files from the previous MinGW JACK installation (i.e.,
  it points to absolute paths starting with C:\msys64\opt)
- Links to the jack.dll.a created by the previous build, instead of libjack.lib
  This means JackRouter.dll will currently depend on libjack-0.dll
- Force includes stdint.h and defines _STDINT_H to avoid int8_t, int32_t and
  uint32_t basic types redefinition during compilation



Distributing JACK
-----------------

An automated installation process should copy files to two destinations. One for
the JACK server binary and standalone tools, and another for the client library.
The latter is needed by JACK enabled applications in order to be able to connect
to the server.

- Open an elevated (admin rights) Windows Power Shell (alternatively you can
perform the steps in Windows Explorer or Windows Command Prompt with different
commands):

- Create a target directory (can be anything else)

mkdir 'C:\Program Files\Jack'

- Copy all files in C:\msys64\opt\jack\bin to target directory

cp C:\msys64\opt\jack\bin\* 'C:\Program Files\Jack'

- Add JACK executables to path

$env:Path += ';C:\Program Files\Jack'

- Copy the following DLLs from C:\msys64\mingw64\bin to C:\Program Files\Jack,
these are dependencies for the JACK server and tools:

cp C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libdb-6.0.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libportaudio-2.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libsamplerate-0.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libsndfile-1.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libstdc++-6.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libsystre-0.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libtre-5.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libwinpthread-1.dll `
  'C:\Program Files\Jack'

- Copy the following files from C:\msys64\opt\jack\lib to C:\Windows to make
libjack available to clients:

cp C:\msys64\opt\jack\lib\libjack64.dll `
  , C:\msys64\opt\jack\lib\libjackserver64.dll `
  C:\Windows

- Copy the following files from C:\msys64\mingw64\bin to C:\Windows, these are
dependencies for libjack. C:\Windows is the directory the current official JACK
1.9.11 binary installer targets, a better solution should be devised to avoid
cluttering the Windows directory:

cp C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libsystre-0.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libtre-5.dll `
  , C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\libwinpthread-1.dll `
  C:\Windows

- Copy all dll files from C:\msys64\opt\jack\lib\jack to C:\Windows\jack, these
are dependencies for libjack:

cp C:\msys64\opt\jack\lib\jack\*.dll C:\Windows\jack

- Start a new Windows Command Prompt or Windows Power Shell session an check if
the JACK server is recognized (this should not start the JACK server but display
the list of available PortAudio devices):

jackd -d portaudio --list-devices



Distributing JackRouter (optional)
----------------------------------

In case you have built JackRouter.

- Copy JackRouter.dll from windows\JackRouter\Release64 to C:\Program Files\Jack
- Copy libjack-0.dll from C:\msys64\mingw64\bin to C:\Program Files\Jack, since
JackRouter depends on libjack but will check for libjack-0.dll instead of the
system-wide libjack64.dll previously copied to C:\Windows. Once done, JackRouter
needs to be registered:

regsvr32 JackRouter.dll



Running JACK
------------

Example of starting the JACK server including MIDI support for a Focusrite USB
audio device using ASIO:
jackd -R -S -X winmme -d portaudio -p 32 -r 48000 -d "ASIO::Focusrite USB ASIO"

Tested working clients:
Ardour
Bitwig Studio
JackRouter
QJackCtl
