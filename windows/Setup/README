This folder contains a script to create an installer for windows.
It uses 'CreateInstall Free'(http://www.createinstall.com), a little software allowing to make simple installers.

You can use the 'jack.ci' script to make the installer. For that, you need to build the Code::Blocks workspace in order to have '.exe' and libraries. 
You also need 'qjackctl' binaries and libraries ('qjackctl.exe', 'mingwm10.dll', 'QtCore4.dll', 'QtGui.dll' and 'QtXml4.dll'). 
You can recompile qjackctl with qt4 or directly get the binaries. The five files are expected in the 'qjackctl' folder.

You also need the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) (the vcrdist_x86.exe file) to be in src folder.

If you need libjack.lib and libjackserver.lib to link with in MS Visual Studio, you can use the MS Tool lib.exe to create the .lib file from de .def.
Just use : 'lib /DEF:libjackserver.def /OUT:libjackserver.lib' and 'lib /DEF:libjack.def /OUT:libjack.lib' to create the lib file.
Or you can also use dlltool, from mingw suite :
Just use : 'dlltool -l libjackserver.lib -D libjackserver.dll -d libjackserver.def' and 'dlltool -l libjack.lib -D libjack.dll -d libjack.def'

Once all binaries are available, just execute the script in 'CreateInstall' to make 'setup.exe'.
The setup will copy all binaries to a specified folder, register the JackRouter (in order to have it in the ASIO drivers list) and create some shortcuts in the start menu.
It's a good and proper way to get jack installed on windows.

64 bits compilation
====================

- for some reasons CodeBlocks create libjack.dll.a and libjack.dll.def names. So the ".dll" part has to be removed before using "lib" tool to create ".lib" files.

- to create 64 bits ".lib" files, the "/MACHINE:X64 option has to be used.
